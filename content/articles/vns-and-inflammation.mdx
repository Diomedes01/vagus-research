## Introduction: The Inflammatory Reflex

In 2000, a discovery at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research changed our understanding of how the nervous system interacts with the immune system. Kevin Tracey and colleagues demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve could dramatically reduce the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) — a key pro-inflammatory cytokine — in an animal model of sepsis (Borovikova et al., 2000). The effect was rapid, potent, and mediated through a previously unknown neural circuit.

Tracey later termed this mechanism the "cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway" (Tracey, 2002), and its implications have reverberated through immunology, neuroscience, and clinical medicine. The discovery revealed that the body possesses a built-in neural circuit for controlling inflammation — and that this circuit can be activated through vagus nerve stimulation.

This article reviews the science behind the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, the clinical evidence for VNS in inflammatory conditions, and the outstanding questions as this field moves from bench to bedside.

## The Cholinergic Anti-Inflammatory Pathway: Mechanism

### The Circuit

The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) operates as a reflex arc (Pavlov & Tracey, 2005):

**Afferent arm:** Peripheral inflammation produces cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that are detected by vagal afferent fibres. These signals travel to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem, alerting the brain that inflammation is occurring.

**Central processing:** The NTS relays inflammatory signals to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which coordinates the efferent response.

**Efferent arm:** Vagal efferent fibres descend to the celiac ganglion, which activates postganglionic splenic nerve fibres. In the spleen, noradrenaline released from these nerve terminals activates β2-adrenergic receptors on choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT+) T cells. These T cells then release acetylcholine, which binds to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR) on macrophages. This binding event is the critical step: it suppresses the nuclear factor NF-κB signalling pathway, thereby inhibiting the production and release of TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kelly et al., 2022).

The elegance of this pathway lies in its precision. Unlike systemic immunosuppressive drugs that broadly dampen immune function, the CAP targets specific immune cells through a discrete receptor mechanism, reducing excessive inflammation without eliminating the immune response entirely.

### Key Molecular Players

- **Acetylcholine (ACh)** — The principal neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, released by ChAT+ T cells in the spleen as the final chemical messenger in the pathway
- **α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR)** — The receptor on macrophages that, when activated, suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This receptor has been established as the terminal effector of the CAP
- **TNF-α** — The primary cytokine target of the CAP; its excessive production drives tissue damage in many inflammatory diseases
- **IL-1β, IL-6, HMGB1** — Additional pro-inflammatory mediators that are suppressed by CAP activation

## Preclinical Evidence

The preclinical evidence for the CAP is extensive and compelling. Vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to:

- **Reduce TNF levels in endotoxemia** — The original Borovikova et al. (2000) finding has been replicated numerous times. VNS dramatically reduces serum TNF in animal models of sepsis, an effect that is abolished by vagotomy.
- **Require α7nAChR activation** — Studies in α7nAChR knockout mice have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of VNS depends on this receptor (Wang et al., 2003).
- **Operate through the spleen** — Splenectomy abolishes the anti-inflammatory effect of cervical VNS, confirming that the spleen is the principal site of immune modulation (Huston et al., 2006).
- **Protect against organ injury** — VNS has shown protective effects in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

## Clinical Evidence

### Rheumatoid Arthritis: The Koopman Trial

The landmark clinical study translating the CAP from bench to bedside was conducted by Koopman et al. (2016). In this open-label pilot study, 17 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) received implanted VNS devices. The results were remarkable: VNS significantly inhibited TNF production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and improved clinical signs of disease as measured by the DAS28-CRP (Disease Activity Score). Multiple patients achieved clinically meaningful reductions in disease severity.

This study provided the first direct evidence that the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway could be therapeutically activated in humans to reduce inflammation in an autoimmune disease.

### Crohn's Disease

Bonaz et al. (2016) conducted a pilot study of chronic VNS in seven patients with active Crohn's disease. After six months of stimulation, five of seven patients achieved clinical remission, and endoscopic healing was observed in several patients. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased, consistent with a systemic anti-inflammatory effect. While the study was small and uncontrolled, the results were sufficiently encouraging to stimulate further investigation.

### Systematic Review of Autoimmune Conditions

A systematic review by Lombo et al. (2025) evaluated VNS across multiple autoimmune conditions, including RA, Crohn's disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis. Across 12 clinical trials, more than half of studies found reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels after VNS. The most consistent finding was a reduction in IL-6 levels (6 of 7 studies), followed by CRP (6 of 9 studies) and TNF-α (4 of 8 studies).

The authors concluded that while VNS shows promise for reducing inflammation in autoimmune diseases, more studies with robust designs are needed to confidently support VNS as a therapeutic option.

### Transcutaneous VNS and Inflammation

A critical question is whether non-invasive taVNS can activate the CAP with sufficient intensity to produce clinically meaningful anti-inflammatory effects. The evidence here is more mixed.

Several smaller studies have demonstrated that taVNS can acutely increase HRV and modulate markers of autonomic function, which may indirectly reduce inflammation. However, a large randomised controlled trial by Vetter et al. (2024) found that transcutaneous cervical VNS did not reduce plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ) in 131 patients with diabetes over 56 days of treatment. The authors noted that the low-grade inflammation characteristic of diabetes may be more difficult to detect and modulate than the high-grade inflammation seen in autoimmune diseases.

A meta-analysis by Schiweck et al. (2024) also found no consistent evidence for the anti-inflammatory effect of VNS in humans across the broader literature, highlighting the gap between compelling preclinical data and more equivocal clinical results.

## The Translation Gap

### Why Preclinical Promise Has Not Fully Translated

Several factors may explain the discrepancy between the robust preclinical evidence and the more modest clinical results:

1. **Stimulation intensity** — Implanted VNS directly stimulates the cervical vagus nerve trunk, activating both afferent and efferent fibres with predictable intensity. Transcutaneous approaches stimulate much smaller auricular or cervical branches, and the degree to which these signals propagate to activate the splenic anti-inflammatory circuit is uncertain.

2. **Inflammation severity** — The preclinical models typically involve acute, high-grade inflammation (endotoxemia, collagen-induced arthritis) where cytokine levels are dramatically elevated. Clinical conditions often involve chronic, low-grade inflammation where changes may be harder to detect.

3. **Measurement timing** — The anti-inflammatory effects of VNS may be transient, and single blood draws may miss the window of peak cytokine suppression.

4. **Individual variability** — Vagal tone varies considerably between individuals, and patients with reduced baseline vagal function may respond differently to stimulation.

### A Nuanced View

The most balanced interpretation of the current evidence is that VNS can modulate inflammation in humans, but the effect is most reliably demonstrated with implanted devices in patients with active, high-grade inflammatory diseases. Whether transcutaneous VNS can produce comparable anti-inflammatory effects remains an open and actively investigated question.

## Beyond Autoimmune Disease: Broader Implications

### Neuroinflammation and Depression

The inflammatory hypothesis of depression suggests that chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to depressive symptoms in a subset of patients. Elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP have been consistently associated with MDD. If VNS can reduce peripheral inflammation through the CAP, this may represent one mechanism through which VNS exerts its antidepressant effects — effectively treating the inflammatory component of depression (Bonaz et al., 2016).

### Post-Operative Recovery

Emerging research is exploring whether VNS can reduce post-operative inflammation and accelerate recovery. The rationale is that surgery triggers a systemic inflammatory response, and activating the CAP perioperatively could attenuate this response and improve outcomes.

### Metabolic Syndrome

Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognised as a driver of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease. Early-stage research is investigating whether VNS could address the inflammatory component of these conditions, though clinical data remain preliminary.

## Future Directions

The field of VNS for inflammation is evolving in several important directions:

- **Splenic nerve stimulation** — Direct stimulation of the splenic nerve, as the final neural element of the CAP, is being investigated in feasibility studies for RA (NCT05003310), potentially offering a more targeted approach than cervical VNS.
- **Bioelectronic medicine** — The broader concept of using neural stimulation to treat disease — championed by Tracey and others — is gaining traction, with VNS as the flagship application.
- **Dose optimisation** — Systematic studies of stimulation parameters (frequency, intensity, duration, timing relative to inflammatory triggers) are needed to identify the therapeutic window for anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Biomarker-guided treatment** — Identifying which patients have the inflammatory profile most likely to respond to VNS could improve treatment outcomes and trial design.

## Conclusion

The discovery of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway represents one of the most significant advances in neuroimmunology in recent decades. It reveals that the body possesses a built-in neural circuit for controlling inflammation, and that this circuit can be therapeutically activated through vagus nerve stimulation.

The clinical translation is ongoing. Implanted VNS has shown clear anti-inflammatory effects in pilot studies of RA and Crohn's disease. However, the broader clinical evidence — particularly for transcutaneous VNS — remains mixed, and the gap between striking preclinical results and more equivocal human data is a central challenge for the field.

What is not in doubt is the fundamental biology: the vagus nerve is a key regulator of immune function, and harnessing this neural-immune interface represents a genuinely novel approach to treating inflammatory disease.
