## Introduction: Anxiety and the Autonomic Nervous System

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental health conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated 301 million people globally according to the World Health Organisation (2023). Despite the availability of pharmacological and psychological treatments, a significant proportion of individuals with anxiety disorders do not achieve adequate symptom relief — approximately 30–40% of patients do not respond fully to first-line treatments (Bandelow et al., 2017).

This treatment gap has driven growing interest in **neuromodulation** approaches, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), as complementary or alternative strategies for managing anxiety. The rationale for targeting the vagus nerve in anxiety is grounded in a well-established body of research linking **autonomic nervous system dysregulation** to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

In simple terms: anxiety is not just a psychological experience — it is profoundly physiological. The racing heart, shallow breathing, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal distress that accompany anxiety are all manifestations of autonomic imbalance, specifically an overactivation of the sympathetic ("fight or flight") nervous system and a withdrawal of parasympathetic ("rest and digest") activity mediated by the vagus nerve.

This article reviews the current evidence on vagus nerve stimulation — particularly transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) — as a potential approach for addressing anxiety through autonomic regulation.

## The Vagal Tone Hypothesis: Why the Vagus Nerve Matters for Anxiety

The theoretical foundation connecting the vagus nerve to anxiety rests largely on the concept of **vagal tone** — the degree of parasympathetic influence exerted by the vagus nerve on the heart and other organs. Higher vagal tone reflects a nervous system that can efficiently regulate itself, transitioning smoothly between states of activation and calm.

Stephen Porges' **Polyvagal Theory** (1995, 2011) provides an influential framework for understanding this relationship. The theory proposes that the vagus nerve — specifically its myelinated ventral branch — plays a critical role in social engagement and emotional regulation. When the ventral vagal complex is functioning optimally, individuals can maintain a sense of safety and calm even in challenging situations. When this system is compromised, the body defaults to sympathetic mobilisation (anxiety, hypervigilance) or, in extreme cases, dorsal vagal shutdown (dissociation, freeze responses).

Complementing the Polyvagal Theory, the **Neurovisceral Integration Model** proposed by Thayer and Lane (2000) posits that vagal tone is an index of the brain's capacity to flexibly regulate emotional and physiological responses. According to this model, low vagal tone reflects a system that is "stuck" in a defensive mode — predisposed to perceiving threat and poorly equipped to down-regulate the stress response.

Both frameworks converge on a central prediction: **individuals with lower vagal tone should be more vulnerable to anxiety, and interventions that increase vagal tone may help reduce anxiety symptoms**.

## Heart Rate Variability: A Window into Vagal Tone

**Heart rate variability (HRV)** — the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate — is the most widely used biomarker of vagal tone. Contrary to what one might expect, a healthy heart does not beat with mechanical regularity. Instead, it exhibits subtle, moment-to-moment fluctuations driven largely by vagal input to the sinoatrial node.

Higher HRV indicates greater vagal influence and more adaptive autonomic regulation. Lower HRV reflects reduced vagal tone and is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes.

The relationship between HRV and anxiety is one of the most robust findings in psychophysiology:

- A **meta-analysis by Chalmers et al. (2014)** examining 36 studies found that individuals with anxiety disorders had significantly lower HRV than healthy controls, with a moderate-to-large effect size
- Reduced HRV has been observed across multiple anxiety subtypes, including **generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)**, **social anxiety disorder**, **panic disorder**, and **post-traumatic stress disorder** (Friedman, 2007)
- Critically, low HRV is not merely a correlate of anxiety — prospective studies suggest it may be a **risk factor**, predicting the development of anxiety symptoms over time (Jandackova et al., 2016)

This body of evidence has led researchers to hypothesise that interventions capable of **increasing vagal tone (as indexed by HRV)** may have anxiolytic effects. VNS, by directly activating vagal afferent pathways, is a logical candidate.

## Clinical Evidence: Randomised Controlled Trials on taVNS for Anxiety

Research into taVNS for anxiety has progressed from early proof-of-concept studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), though the field remains relatively young. A **narrative review by Burger et al. (2020)** examined potential biomarkers for taVNS effects, while a **critical review by Yap et al. (2020)** assessed the broader challenges of translating taVNS findings into clinical practice — both identifying multiple studies that have investigated the effects of taVNS on anxiety outcomes.

### Key Findings from the Literature

**Acute anxiety reduction:** Several studies have demonstrated that a single session of taVNS can reduce self-reported state anxiety in both healthy volunteers and clinical populations. Lamb et al. (2017) found that taVNS significantly reduced anxiety ratings in individuals with PTSD, while Burger et al. (2017) reported that taVNS reduced fear-potentiated startle responses — a physiological measure of anxiety.

**Effects on worry and rumination:** Sellaro et al. (2015) found that taVNS reduced repetitive negative thinking — a cognitive hallmark of anxiety and depression — in a randomised sham-controlled crossover design. This finding suggests that taVNS may influence not only physiological arousal but also the cognitive processes that maintain anxiety.

**Multi-session protocols:** Emerging evidence from studies using repeated taVNS sessions over days to weeks suggests cumulative benefits. Bretherton et al. (2019), in a study of daily taVNS in adults aged 55 and older, reported improvements in autonomic function (increased HRV) and subjective wellbeing, including reduced tension and anxiety, after two weeks of daily stimulation.

**Clinical populations:** Trevizol et al. (2016) conducted a pilot study of taVNS in patients with major depressive disorder and comorbid anxiety, reporting significant reductions in both depression and anxiety scores. While the sample was small, the results are consistent with the broader pattern of anxiolytic effects observed across studies.

### Current State of the Evidence

Reviews by Burger et al. (2020) and Yap et al. (2020) have examined the growing body of taVNS research. Their conclusions are cautiously optimistic:

- The evidence suggests that taVNS **may reduce anxiety**, but the field is characterised by significant heterogeneity in study designs, stimulation parameters, and outcome measures
- Effects appear more consistent for **physiological measures** (HRV, startle response, skin conductance) than for self-report questionnaires, possibly reflecting the autonomic pathway through which taVNS acts
- Larger, well-powered RCTs with standardised protocols are needed to confirm efficacy and identify optimal stimulation parameters

## Mechanism: How VNS May Modulate the Anxiety Circuit

The potential anxiolytic effects of VNS can be understood through its influence on key brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in fear and anxiety processing.

### The NTS–Locus Coeruleus–Noradrenaline Pathway

When taVNS activates the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, signals travel to the **nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)** in the brainstem, which projects to the **locus coeruleus (LC)** — the brain's primary noradrenergic centre. The LC plays a critical role in arousal, attention, and stress responses.

Research suggests that VNS modulates LC activity in a way that promotes **tonic (baseline) noradrenaline release** while reducing **phasic (stress-triggered) noradrenaline bursts** (Manta et al., 2009). This shift may help establish a more stable baseline arousal state, reducing the hypervigilance and exaggerated startle responses characteristic of anxiety.

### Amygdala Modulation

The **amygdala** is the brain's primary fear-processing centre, and overactivation of the amygdala is a hallmark of anxiety disorders. Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that taVNS can modulate amygdala activity:

- Frangos, Ellrich and Komisaruk (2015) showed that taVNS reduced activation in the amygdala during fMRI scanning
- Kraus et al. (2013) demonstrated that taVNS at the cymba conchae led to decreased BOLD signal in the amygdala and hippocampus — regions central to fear memory and emotional processing

These neuroimaging findings provide a plausible neural mechanism for the anxiolytic effects observed in behavioural studies.

### Prefrontal Cortex Engagement

The **prefrontal cortex (PFC)** — particularly the medial and ventrolateral regions — is involved in the top-down regulation of emotional responses. In anxiety disorders, prefrontal control over amygdala reactivity is often impaired, leading to difficulty suppressing fear responses (Bishop, 2007).

Evidence indicates that taVNS may enhance prefrontal cortical engagement. Badran et al. (2018) demonstrated that taVNS increased functional connectivity between the NTS, prefrontal cortex, and limbic structures, potentially strengthening the regulatory pathways that are compromised in anxiety.

### GABAergic and Serotonergic Modulation

VNS has been shown to influence the release of **gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)** — the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter — and **serotonin**, both of which are centrally involved in anxiety regulation. Conventional anxiolytic medications (benzodiazepines and SSRIs) work through these same neurotransmitter systems, suggesting that VNS may engage overlapping biological pathways through a different route (Ben-Menachem et al., 1995; Dorr & Debonnel, 2006).

## taVNS and Generalised Anxiety Disorder

**Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)** — characterised by persistent, excessive worry across multiple domains — is one of the most common anxiety disorders and is strongly associated with autonomic dysregulation (Thayer et al., 2012).

The autonomic profile of GAD is well-documented: individuals with GAD consistently show **reduced HRV**, elevated resting heart rate, and blunted autonomic flexibility (Chalmers et al., 2014). This profile makes GAD a particularly compelling target for taVNS, which directly addresses autonomic imbalance.

While large-scale RCTs specifically targeting GAD with taVNS are still needed, the available evidence is encouraging. Studies in populations with elevated anxiety — including healthy individuals under experimental stress, individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression, and clinical populations with PTSD — have consistently reported reductions in anxiety markers following taVNS.

Importantly, a study by Clancy et al. (2014) demonstrated that taVNS reduced sympathetic nerve activity and shifted autonomic balance toward parasympathetic dominance in healthy volunteers — providing direct physiological evidence for the autonomic mechanism hypothesised to underlie anxiolytic effects.

## VNS Effects on Physiological Anxiety Markers

Beyond self-reported anxiety scales, several studies have examined the effects of taVNS on objective physiological markers of anxiety:

### Heart Rate Variability

Multiple studies have reported that taVNS **increases HRV**, reflecting enhanced vagal tone:

- Clancy et al. (2014) found that taVNS increased high-frequency HRV (a marker of parasympathetic activity) in healthy volunteers
- Bretherton et al. (2019) reported improvements in autonomic balance after two weeks of daily taVNS in older adults
- De Couck et al. (2012) observed acute increases in HRV during taVNS in healthy participants

### Cortisol and Stress Hormones

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a key mediator of the stress response, and chronic HPA axis dysregulation is implicated in anxiety disorders. Preliminary evidence suggests that taVNS may modulate cortisol levels, though findings are mixed and further research is needed (Warren et al., 2019).

### Electrodermal Activity

Skin conductance — a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation — has been used as an objective marker of anxiety in several taVNS studies. Burger et al. (2017) reported that taVNS reduced fear-potentiated skin conductance responses, consistent with reduced sympathetic arousal.

### Inflammatory Markers

Chronic low-grade inflammation has been increasingly recognised as a contributor to anxiety (Michopoulos et al., 2017). Given the well-established anti-inflammatory effects of vagal activation via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Tracey, 2002), it is plausible that some of the anxiolytic effects of taVNS may be mediated through reduction of inflammatory cytokines — though direct evidence for this mechanism in anxiety populations remains limited.

## Limitations of Current Research

While the evidence for taVNS as an anxiolytic intervention is promising, several important limitations must be acknowledged:

**Sample sizes:** Many studies have used small sample sizes (typically 20–60 participants), limiting statistical power and the generalisability of findings.

**Heterogeneity of protocols:** There is significant variability across studies in stimulation parameters (frequency, intensity, pulse width), session duration, number of sessions, and electrode placement. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to compare results directly and to identify optimal treatment protocols.

**Sham stimulation challenges:** Designing an effective sham (placebo) condition for taVNS is methodologically difficult. Many studies use stimulation of the earlobe as a sham control, but debate exists about whether earlobe stimulation is truly inert — some evidence suggests it may produce mild physiological effects (Badran et al., 2018).

**Short study durations:** The majority of taVNS studies have been acute (single-session) or short-term (days to weeks). Long-term efficacy and the durability of anxiolytic effects remain largely unknown.

**Lack of head-to-head comparisons:** Few studies have directly compared taVNS to established anxiety treatments (medication, cognitive behavioural therapy), making it difficult to contextualise the magnitude of the observed effects.

**Publication bias:** As in many fields, there may be a bias toward publishing positive findings, potentially inflating the apparent efficacy of taVNS for anxiety.

## Future Directions

The field of taVNS for anxiety is evolving rapidly, with several promising directions for future research:

- **Large-scale, multi-site RCTs** with standardised protocols and adequate statistical power to definitively establish efficacy for specific anxiety disorders
- **Dose-finding studies** to optimise stimulation parameters (frequency, intensity, duration, number of sessions) for anxiolytic effects
- **Mechanistic studies** using neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and biomarkers (HRV, cortisol, inflammatory cytokines) to elucidate the pathways through which taVNS reduces anxiety
- **Combination therapy research** exploring whether taVNS can enhance the effects of established treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy or exposure therapy
- **Personalised approaches** investigating whether baseline autonomic profiles (e.g., resting HRV) or genetic factors predict individual responsiveness to taVNS
- **Home-based and long-term protocols** assessing the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of self-administered daily taVNS over months to years
- **Transdiagnostic applications** examining whether the autonomic rebalancing effects of taVNS may benefit not only anxiety disorders but also related conditions characterised by autonomic dysregulation (depression, PTSD, insomnia)

## Summary: The Evidence on taVNS and Anxiety

The current evidence base, while still maturing, provides a coherent and scientifically grounded rationale for the use of taVNS as an approach to managing anxiety:

**What the evidence supports:**
- Anxiety disorders are consistently associated with reduced vagal tone (low HRV) and autonomic dysregulation
- taVNS activates vagal afferent pathways that project to brain regions involved in anxiety regulation (NTS, locus coeruleus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex)
- Clinical studies have demonstrated that taVNS can reduce self-reported anxiety, modulate physiological anxiety markers (HRV, startle response, skin conductance), and influence the brain circuits underlying fear processing
- taVNS has a favourable safety profile, with most side effects being mild and transient (Kim et al., 2022)

**What remains to be established:**
- The optimal stimulation parameters for anxiolytic effects
- Long-term efficacy and durability of benefits
- Whether taVNS is effective as a standalone treatment or primarily as an adjunct to existing therapies
- Which specific anxiety disorders and patient profiles are most likely to benefit

The convergence of evidence from autonomic neuroscience, psychophysiology, neuroimaging, and clinical trials paints a compelling picture of a mechanistically plausible and empirically supported approach. As larger and more rigorous trials are completed, the role of taVNS in the management of anxiety disorders will become increasingly well-defined.
