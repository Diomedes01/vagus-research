## Introduction: Where It All Began

Vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy has the longest clinical track record of any VNS application — spanning more than three decades from the first human implant in 1988 to over 125,000 patients treated worldwide. It was the condition that proved VNS could work as a therapy, and it remains the gold standard against which all other VNS applications are measured.

The story begins with a simple hypothesis: if epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal synchronised electrical activity in the brain, could stimulating the vagus nerve — which sends projections to widespread cortical and subcortical regions — desynchronise that activity and prevent seizures?

In 1985, Jacob Zabara proposed exactly this, demonstrating in animal models that intermittent vagus nerve stimulation could suppress seizure activity (Zabara, 1985). The first human implant followed in 1988, and the FDA approved VNS therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy in 1997. This article reviews the evidence that underpins this approval, the evolution of VNS therapy for epilepsy, and the emerging role of non-invasive approaches.

## The Problem: Drug-Resistant Epilepsy

Epilepsy affects approximately 50 million people worldwide, making it one of the most common neurological conditions. While antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are effective for the majority of patients, approximately 30% develop drug-resistant epilepsy — defined as failure to achieve sustained seizure freedom after adequate trials of two or more appropriately chosen AEDs (Kwan et al., 2010).

For these patients, the options are limited. Resective surgery (removing the brain tissue where seizures originate) can be curative but is only feasible when a single, identifiable seizure focus can be safely removed. Many patients are not surgical candidates due to multifocal seizures, seizure foci in eloquent cortex, or patient preference.

VNS emerged to fill this gap — offering a non-destructive, reversible neuromodulation approach for patients who had exhausted pharmacological options and were not candidates for resective surgery.

## Pivotal Clinical Trials

### The E03 and E05 Trials

The FDA approval of VNS for epilepsy was based primarily on two randomised controlled trials known as E03 and E05.

**The E03 trial** (Ben-Menachem et al., 1994) randomised 114 patients with drug-resistant partial seizures to receive either high-stimulation (therapeutic) or low-stimulation (active control) VNS over 14 weeks. The high-stimulation group achieved a 24.5% median reduction in seizure frequency compared to 6.1% in the low-stimulation group — a statistically significant difference.

**The E05 trial** (Handforth et al., 1998) was larger, enrolling 254 patients with a similar design. High-stimulation VNS produced a 28% median reduction in seizure frequency versus 15% in the low-stimulation group. The responder rate (≥50% seizure reduction) was 23% in the high-stimulation group compared to 16% in controls.

While these acute-phase results were modest, they established proof of concept: VNS could reduce seizure frequency in patients who had not responded to medications.

### The Meta-Analytic Picture

Englot et al. (2011) conducted the most comprehensive meta-analysis of VNS efficacy in epilepsy, pooling data from 74 studies involving 3,321 patients. Their analysis revealed several important patterns:

- **Overall efficacy:** Approximately 50% of patients achieved at least 50% seizure reduction with VNS
- **Progressive improvement:** Efficacy increased over time, with better outcomes at 2–3 years compared to 3 months
- **Seizure freedom:** About 8% of patients achieved complete seizure freedom — a notable outcome in a drug-resistant population
- **Predictors of response:** Younger age at implantation and certain seizure types (generalised epilepsy) were associated with better outcomes

## Long-Term Outcomes: The Key Advantage

### Progressive Improvement

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of VNS for epilepsy is that it gets better over time. Unlike medications, where tolerance can develop, the efficacy of VNS tends to increase progressively over months and years of treatment.

Elliott et al. (2011) reported on 436 consecutive patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy who received VNS. At last follow-up (mean 5 years), 63.8% of patients had achieved at least 50% seizure reduction — substantially higher than the acute-phase results from the pivotal trials. The mechanism behind this progressive improvement is not fully understood but may relate to slow-onset neuroplastic changes in seizure networks.

### Paediatric Populations

VNS has shown particular promise in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Orosz et al. (2014) studied 347 paediatric patients and found progressive improvement over 24 months, with 32% of patients achieving at least 50% seizure reduction. The safety profile in children was comparable to that in adults.

## How VNS Reduces Seizures: Proposed Mechanisms

Despite three decades of clinical use, the precise mechanism by which VNS suppresses seizures is not completely understood. Several complementary mechanisms have been proposed:

### Desynchronisation

Zabara's original hypothesis remains relevant. Vagal afferent stimulation activates the NTS, which projects to widespread cortical regions through the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and thalamus. This broad activation pattern may disrupt the hypersynchronous neuronal firing that characterises seizures.

### Neurotransmitter Modulation

VNS increases noradrenaline release from the locus coeruleus and serotonin release from the dorsal raphe nucleus — both of which have anticonvulsant properties. Noradrenaline, in particular, raises seizure thresholds and may be a key mediator of VNS efficacy in epilepsy (Manta et al., 2009).

### Thalamic and Cortical Effects

Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that VNS modulates activity in the thalamus, a structure that plays a critical role in seizure generalisation. By influencing thalamic gating functions, VNS may prevent focal seizure activity from spreading to become generalised seizures.

### Neuroplasticity

The progressive improvement in seizure control over time suggests that VNS induces long-term changes in neural circuits. These may include alterations in synaptic connectivity, changes in receptor expression, and restructuring of seizure networks — though the specific mechanisms remain under investigation.

## The Device and Procedure

### Implanted VNS

The standard VNS therapy system consists of a pulse generator (similar in size to a cardiac pacemaker) implanted in the left chest wall, connected by a lead to electrodes wrapped around the left cervical vagus nerve. The left side is used to minimise cardiac effects, as the right vagus nerve has more direct cardiac innervation.

The device delivers intermittent electrical pulses — typically 30 seconds on, 5 minutes off — in a continuous cycle. Parameters including output current, frequency, pulse width, and on/off times can be adjusted non-invasively by the clinician using a programming wand. Patients are also given a magnet that can trigger additional stimulation if they feel a seizure approaching.

### Newer Devices

Recent advances include:
- **Responsive (closed-loop) stimulation** — Newer VNS systems can detect changes in heart rate that may signal an impending seizure and automatically deliver additional stimulation
- **MRI-compatible designs** — Allowing patients with VNS devices to undergo MRI scanning
- **Smaller generators** — Reducing the size and profile of the implanted device

## Transcutaneous VNS for Epilepsy

### Clinical Evidence

While implanted VNS has the strongest evidence base, transcutaneous approaches are being investigated for epilepsy. Yang et al. (2023) conducted a randomised, double-blind clinical trial of taVNS for drug-resistant epilepsy and reported reductions in seizure frequency with active stimulation compared to sham.

The appeal of transcutaneous VNS for epilepsy lies in its non-invasive nature, which could expand access to patients who are not candidates for or who decline surgical implantation. However, the evidence base is much smaller than for implanted VNS, and it remains unclear whether transcutaneous stimulation can achieve comparable efficacy.

## Safety and Tolerability

### Implanted VNS

The safety profile of implanted VNS has been extensively documented over decades of clinical use. Ben-Menachem (2002) and others have identified the following common side effects:

- **Voice alteration/hoarseness** — The most common side effect, occurring during stimulation periods due to the proximity of the vagus nerve to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Typically mild and intermittent.
- **Cough and throat discomfort** — Related to stimulation and usually diminishing over time
- **Dyspnoea** — Mild shortness of breath during stimulation, reported by some patients
- **Surgical risks** — Infection (1–3%), haematoma, and rarely, vocal cord paralysis

The safety profile of VNS compares favourably with the side effects of many antiepileptic drugs, including cognitive impairment, weight gain, and teratogenicity. Importantly, VNS does not produce the cognitive side effects that limit many AEDs.

### Transcutaneous VNS

The safety of transcutaneous approaches has been documented in a systematic review by Kim et al. (2022), which found that taVNS was generally well-tolerated with only mild, transient side effects.

## VNS in the Epilepsy Treatment Landscape

VNS occupies a specific niche in epilepsy management: it is typically considered for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery, or as an adjunct in patients who have had incomplete responses to other treatments.

The treatment algorithm typically proceeds:
1. **First-line AEDs** → inadequate response
2. **Second-line AEDs / combination therapy** → inadequate response
3. **Surgical evaluation** → not a candidate or incomplete response
4. **VNS and/or other neuromodulation** (responsive neurostimulation, deep brain stimulation)

VNS is not curative — it reduces seizure frequency and severity rather than eliminating seizures entirely. However, for patients who have exhausted other options, even partial seizure reduction can meaningfully improve quality of life, reduce injury risk, and in some cases allow medication reduction.

## Conclusion

VNS for epilepsy represents the most mature application of vagus nerve stimulation in clinical medicine. With over 125,000 patients treated, decades of safety data, and meta-analytic evidence showing that approximately half of drug-resistant patients achieve at least 50% seizure reduction, VNS has earned its place as a standard treatment option for drug-resistant epilepsy.

The key features that define VNS for epilepsy — progressive improvement over time, a favourable safety profile compared to medications, and the ability to be combined with other treatments — make it a model for how VNS may eventually be used in other conditions. As transcutaneous approaches mature and closed-loop devices become more sophisticated, the next chapter of VNS for epilepsy is likely to expand access and further improve outcomes.
