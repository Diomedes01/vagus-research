If you've been following research on vagus nerve stimulation, you've likely encountered several abbreviations — iVNS, taVNS, tcVNS. These refer to fundamentally different approaches to stimulating the same nerve, and they differ in their mechanisms, their evidence base, their safety profiles, and their accessibility.

In this episode, we'll compare these approaches — implanted vagus nerve stimulation versus transcutaneous methods — and examine what the research tells us about each.

## SECTION 1: IMPLANTED VNS — THE ORIGINAL

[VISUAL CUE: Timeline graphic — 1988 first human implant, 1997 FDA approval for epilepsy, 2005 FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression. Device illustration showing pulse generator, lead wire, and electrode on the left cervical vagus nerve.]

Implanted vagus nerve stimulation — abbreviated iVNS — is the original form of VNS therapy. It involves a surgical procedure in which a small pulse generator, roughly the size of a stopwatch, is implanted under the skin of the chest. A lead wire runs from the generator up to the left cervical vagus nerve in the neck, where a helical electrode is wrapped around the nerve.

The first human implantation was performed by Jacob Zabara and colleagues in 1988. Following years of clinical trials, the device — manufactured by LivaNova, formerly Cyberonics — received FDA approval for drug-resistant epilepsy in 1997, and for treatment-resistant depression in 2005.

The implanted device stimulates the main trunk of the cervical vagus nerve, which contains the full complement of vagal fibres — both afferent and efferent, spanning a wide range of diameters and functions. Stimulation parameters are programmed by a clinician and the device delivers intermittent pulses automatically — typically thirty seconds on, five minutes off — throughout the day.

Because it directly contacts the nerve trunk, iVNS provides robust and consistent fibre activation. The evidence base for implanted VNS is extensive — decades of clinical data in epilepsy and depression, with response rates typically in the range of forty to sixty per cent for seizure reduction in drug-resistant epilepsy patients.

However, it requires surgery under general anaesthesia, carries risks including infection, vocal cord paresis, and device malfunction, and costs tens of thousands of dollars. It is typically reserved for patients who have failed multiple other treatments.

## SECTION 2: TRANSCUTANEOUS AURICULAR VNS

[VISUAL CUE: Anatomical diagram of the external ear, with the cymba conchae and tragus highlighted. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) is traced from the ear to the brainstem.]

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation — taVNS — is a non-invasive approach that stimulates the auricular branch of the vagus nerve through the skin of the ear.

The auricular branch, sometimes called Arnold's nerve, is the only peripheral branch of the vagus nerve that reaches the body surface. It innervates specific regions of the external ear — primarily the cymba conchae and the inner tragus. By placing electrodes on these areas and delivering mild electrical current, researchers can activate vagal afferent fibres without surgery.

[VISUAL CUE: Side-by-side comparison — the ear clip or electrode in position on the cymba conchae, alongside an fMRI brain image showing NTS and brainstem activation.]

The key validation for taVNS came from neuroimaging studies. Frangos and colleagues demonstrated in 2015 that taVNS at the cymba conchae activates the nucleus tractus solitarius and produces patterns of brain activation consistent with those observed during implanted VNS. Kraus and colleagues similarly showed brainstem and cortical activation using fMRI during auricular stimulation.

This was important because it confirmed that the non-invasive approach was engaging the intended neural target — the vagal afferent pathway to the brainstem.

taVNS has since been investigated in clinical trials for depression, anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, tinnitus, migraine, and inflammatory conditions. The results are promising, though the evidence base is younger and generally composed of smaller trials compared to implanted VNS.

The major advantages are obvious: no surgery, no anaesthesia, minimal side effects, and dramatically lower cost. Devices are portable, can be self-administered, and sessions typically last twenty to sixty minutes.

## SECTION 3: TRANSCUTANEOUS CERVICAL VNS

[VISUAL CUE: Illustration of a handheld device placed against the neck, over the cervical vagus nerve. The gammaCore device is shown as an example.]

There is a third approach worth mentioning: transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation, or tcVNS. This involves placing a handheld device against the skin of the neck, over the cervical vagus nerve, and delivering electrical stimulation non-invasively through the skin.

The most well-known tcVNS device is gammaCore, which has received FDA clearance for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine and cluster headache. Unlike taVNS, which targets the auricular branch, tcVNS targets the main cervical trunk — the same nerve accessed by the implanted device, but from outside the body.

[VISUAL CUE: Comparison diagram — iVNS electrode directly on the nerve, tcVNS stimulating through skin and tissue layers.]

The trade-off is that the electrical signal must pass through skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle to reach the nerve, which means higher current intensities are required and fibre recruitment is less selective. Research is ongoing to determine how tcVNS activation patterns compare to direct implanted stimulation.

## SECTION 4: COMPARING THE EVIDENCE

[VISUAL CUE: Three-column comparison table appearing progressively. Columns: iVNS, taVNS, tcVNS. Rows: mechanism, evidence level, approved indications, safety profile, cost, accessibility.]

Let's compare these approaches systematically.

For implanted VNS, the evidence base spans over thirty years. Multiple large randomised controlled trials support its efficacy in drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. It is considered a well-established therapy with regulatory approvals in numerous countries.

For taVNS, the evidence is growing rapidly. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Kim and colleagues in 2022 analysed one hundred and seventy-seven studies involving over six thousand three hundred subjects receiving VNS — including both implanted and transcutaneous approaches. The analysis found that both forms demonstrated favourable safety profiles across twenty-one clinical populations.

[VISUAL CUE: Citation card — "Kim et al., 2022, Scientific Reports — 177 studies, 6,322+ subjects."]

Importantly, taVNS showed very low rates of serious adverse events. The most commonly reported side effects were mild and localised: tingling, redness, or minor discomfort at the stimulation site. This contrasts with implanted VNS, where surgical complications — though infrequent — include infection, haematoma, vocal cord dysfunction, and device-related issues.

For tcVNS, the evidence is more condition-specific. The gammaCore device has been evaluated in randomised controlled trials for migraine and cluster headache, with positive results leading to regulatory clearance. Its evidence base for other conditions is still developing.

## SECTION 5: WHEN IS EACH APPROPRIATE?

[VISUAL CUE: Decision-tree style graphic — starting with "clinical context" and branching to different modalities based on condition severity, previous treatments, and access considerations.]

The choice between these approaches depends on the clinical context.

Implanted VNS is typically considered for patients with severe, treatment-resistant conditions — particularly epilepsy and depression — who have exhausted other options. The higher risk and cost are justified by the severity of the condition and the strength of the evidence.

[VISUAL CUE: Spectrum graphic — from most invasive and most evidence (iVNS) to least invasive and growing evidence (taVNS).]

taVNS occupies a different position. Its non-invasive nature and favourable safety profile make it suitable for broader investigation and, potentially, for conditions where the risk-benefit calculation of surgery would not be justified. Research suggests it may be particularly relevant for conditions involving autonomic dysregulation, mood disorders, pain, and possibly inflammatory conditions — though definitive large-scale trials are still needed.

It is worth noting that taVNS and iVNS may not produce identical effects. Implanted VNS stimulates both afferent and efferent fibres of the cervical trunk, while taVNS primarily activates afferent fibres of the auricular branch. Whether this distinction is clinically meaningful for specific conditions is an active area of investigation.

tcVNS currently has the most focused evidence base — largely for headache disorders — and its position relative to the other approaches is still being defined.

## OUTRO

[VISUAL CUE: The three-column comparison table returns, now fully populated. Fade to Vagus Research logo.]

To summarise: implanted VNS is the most established form, with decades of evidence in epilepsy and depression, but it requires surgery and carries associated risks. Transcutaneous auricular VNS offers a non-invasive alternative that neuroimaging studies confirm engages vagal afferent pathways, with a rapidly growing evidence base and a favourable safety profile. Transcutaneous cervical VNS provides another non-invasive option, with current evidence strongest for headache disorders.

The field is moving toward greater personalisation — matching the right stimulation approach, with the right parameters, to the right patient and condition. As larger trials report results over the coming years, the relative roles of these approaches will become clearer.

In our next episode, we'll explore one specific clinical application in depth — the relationship between the vagus nerve and sleep.
