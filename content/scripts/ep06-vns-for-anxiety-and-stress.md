Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental health conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated 301 million people globally as of recent WHO estimates. Despite the availability of pharmacological and psychological treatments, a significant proportion of patients — between thirty and fifty per cent — do not achieve adequate remission with first-line therapies.

This treatment gap has driven interest in alternative approaches. And one of the most promising is vagus nerve stimulation.

Over the past decade, a growing body of clinical evidence has examined whether stimulating the vagus nerve — particularly non-invasively through the ear — can reduce anxiety symptoms and improve stress resilience. Today, we are going to review that evidence, explore the mechanisms involved, and consider what the research tells us about the potential and the limitations of this approach.

## SECTION 1: ANXIETY AS AUTONOMIC DYSREGULATION

[VISUAL CUE: Animated diagram showing the autonomic nervous system — sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. Highlight the imbalance seen in anxiety: elevated sympathetic, reduced parasympathetic tone.]

To understand why vagus nerve stimulation is relevant to anxiety, we need to start with the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system has two primary divisions: the sympathetic branch, which drives the fight-or-flight response, and the parasympathetic branch, which promotes rest, recovery, and calm.

In healthy individuals, these two systems exist in a dynamic balance. The body shifts between activation and recovery as circumstances demand. But in anxiety disorders, this balance is disrupted. Research consistently shows that individuals with generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder exhibit what is known as low vagal tone — reduced activity in the parasympathetic nervous system — alongside elevated sympathetic activation.

[VISUAL CUE: Graph showing heart rate variability (HRV) differences between healthy controls and individuals with anxiety disorders. Lower HRV in the anxiety group.]

Heart rate variability, or HRV, is the most commonly used biomarker for vagal tone. Multiple meta-analyses have confirmed that individuals with anxiety disorders demonstrate significantly lower HRV compared to healthy controls, reflecting reduced vagal influence on the heart. This is not merely a correlate of anxiety — evidence suggests it may be a contributing mechanism, creating a physiological state that perpetuates anxious arousal.

The question, then, is straightforward: if low vagal tone contributes to anxiety, can increasing vagal activity through stimulation help restore balance?

## SECTION 2: MECHANISMS — HOW VNS MAY REDUCE ANXIETY

[VISUAL CUE: Anatomical pathway diagram showing the vagus nerve connecting to the NTS, then projecting to the locus coeruleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex.]

Vagus nerve stimulation does not act through a single mechanism. The evidence points to several interconnected pathways through which vagal activation may influence anxiety.

**The NTS-Amygdala Pathway.** Vagal afferent fibres project to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem, which in turn sends projections to the amygdala — the brain's primary threat-detection centre. The amygdala is consistently hyperactive in anxiety disorders. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that vagus nerve stimulation can modulate amygdala reactivity, potentially dampening the exaggerated threat responses that characterise anxiety.

[VISUAL CUE: fMRI images showing amygdala activity before and during VNS, with reduced activation highlighted.]

**The HPA Axis and Cortisol.** The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is the body's central stress response system. Chronic anxiety is associated with dysregulation of the HPA axis and elevated cortisol levels. Research suggests that VNS may help normalise HPA axis function, reducing the physiological stress burden.

**Noradrenergic Modulation.** The vagus nerve influences the locus coeruleus, the brain's primary source of noradrenaline. Dysregulated noradrenergic signalling is implicated in anxiety and panic. By modulating locus coeruleus activity, VNS may help stabilise noradrenergic tone.

[VISUAL CUE: Schematic showing three parallel pathways — amygdala modulation, HPA axis regulation, and noradrenergic stabilisation — converging on reduced anxiety.]

**The Anti-Inflammatory Reflex.** There is growing evidence linking systemic inflammation to anxiety. The vagus nerve's cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may indirectly influence mood and anxiety through neuroinflammatory mechanisms.

## SECTION 3: CLINICAL EVIDENCE — KEY STUDIES

[VISUAL CUE: Study summary card — "Tong et al., 2023" with key details in clean typography.]

Let us turn to the clinical data. One of the most important recent trials is the randomised controlled trial published by Tong and colleagues in 2023, which examined transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation in patients with generalised anxiety disorder.

In this study, participants received active taVNS or sham stimulation over a treatment course. The results were striking: the active taVNS group demonstrated a 46.5 per cent response rate, with clinically meaningful reductions in anxiety symptoms as measured by validated scales. This is a notable finding, particularly given that generalised anxiety disorder is often resistant to intervention.

[VISUAL CUE: Bar chart comparing response rates — active taVNS (46.5%) versus sham. Confidence intervals displayed.]

Importantly, this was a properly controlled trial using sham stimulation at the earlobe — a location with minimal vagal innervation. The difference between active and sham groups provides evidence that the effects are not simply due to placebo or the sensation of stimulation itself.

[VISUAL CUE: Study summary card — "Burger et al., 2020" with key details.]

Burger and colleagues, in their 2020 study, took a different approach. Rather than studying clinical populations, they examined the effects of taVNS on cortisol levels in healthy volunteers exposed to a psychosocial stress paradigm. Their findings indicated that taVNS was associated with reduced cortisol responses to stress, suggesting that vagal stimulation may enhance stress resilience even in non-clinical populations.

[VISUAL CUE: Line graph showing cortisol trajectories over time — taVNS group versus control, with the taVNS group showing attenuated cortisol rise following stress induction.]

This study is valuable because it provides a mechanistic bridge. If taVNS can reduce the cortisol response to acute stress, this supports the hypothesis that HPA axis modulation is one of the pathways through which VNS exerts its anxiolytic effects.

## SECTION 4: STATE VERSUS TRAIT ANXIETY

[VISUAL CUE: Diagram distinguishing state anxiety (situational, acute) from trait anxiety (dispositional, chronic). Two parallel columns with characteristics listed.]

An important distinction in the research literature is between state anxiety and trait anxiety. State anxiety is the acute, situational experience of anxiousness — the nervousness before a presentation, the tension during a conflict. Trait anxiety, by contrast, is a stable disposition toward experiencing anxiety across situations.

The existing evidence suggests that taVNS may have more immediate and consistent effects on state anxiety. Several studies have demonstrated acute reductions in self-reported anxiety following single sessions of stimulation. The effects on trait anxiety appear to require longer treatment durations, which is consistent with the idea that reshaping a stable psychological disposition requires sustained neuroplastic change.

[VISUAL CUE: Timeline graphic showing acute effects (state anxiety reduction after single sessions) versus cumulative effects (trait anxiety reduction over weeks of treatment).]

This distinction matters for setting realistic expectations. A single taVNS session may help manage an acute stress response, but addressing a chronic anxiety disorder likely requires sustained, repeated stimulation as part of a broader treatment plan.

## SECTION 5: STRESS RESILIENCE AND VAGAL TONE

[VISUAL CUE: Conceptual diagram of the "vagal brake" — the vagus nerve's role in rapidly modulating arousal states.]

Beyond clinical anxiety disorders, there is growing interest in vagus nerve stimulation as a tool for building stress resilience. The concept of vagal tone — the tonic level of vagal activity — has been linked to emotional regulation capacity. Individuals with higher vagal tone, as indexed by higher resting HRV, tend to demonstrate better emotional flexibility, faster recovery from stress, and more adaptive coping.

This aligns with aspects of polyvagal theory, proposed by Stephen Porges, which frames the vagus nerve as central to the body's social engagement system and its capacity to regulate threat responses. While polyvagal theory remains debated in some of its specifics, the core observation that vagal function relates to emotional regulation capacity is well supported by empirical data.

[VISUAL CUE: Scatter plot showing the correlation between resting HRV and emotional regulation scores, with a positive trend line.]

The implication is that by enhancing vagal tone through repeated stimulation, it may be possible to build a more resilient autonomic baseline — one that is better equipped to handle stress without tipping into pathological anxiety. Several research groups are currently investigating this hypothesis in longitudinal studies.

## SECTION 6: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS

[VISUAL CUE: Clean list format with icons — practical points for interpreting the research.]

It is important to contextualise these findings honestly. While the evidence for VNS in anxiety is promising, there are significant limitations that must be acknowledged.

First, sample sizes in many studies remain small. The Tong et al. trial, while well-designed, had a limited participant pool. Larger, multi-site replication studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Second, there is considerable heterogeneity in stimulation parameters across studies — frequency, intensity, duration, and electrode placement all vary. This makes direct comparison between studies challenging and means that optimal protocols have not yet been established.

[VISUAL CUE: Table comparing stimulation parameters across major anxiety studies — frequency (Hz), pulse width, intensity, session duration, treatment length.]

Third, taVNS should not be viewed as a standalone treatment for clinical anxiety disorders. The most promising clinical model is likely one where taVNS serves as an adjunct to established treatments — cognitive behavioural therapy, medication, or both — rather than a replacement.

Fourth, individual responses vary. Not all participants in clinical trials respond to stimulation, and we do not yet have reliable predictors of who will benefit most.

[VISUAL CUE: Pie chart showing responders versus non-responders in clinical trials, illustrating variability.]

Finally, long-term efficacy data remain limited. Most studies have examined effects over weeks to months. Whether the benefits of taVNS are sustained over years of use, and whether they persist after stimulation is discontinued, are questions that have not yet been adequately answered.

## OUTRO

[VISUAL CUE: Return to the calm heart rate waveform from the opening. Overlay key statistics from the episode. Fade to Vagus Research logo.]

The evidence for vagus nerve stimulation in anxiety and stress is building on a solid mechanistic foundation. We understand the pathways — the NTS, the amygdala, the HPA axis, the locus coeruleus. We have neuroimaging data showing that taVNS engages these circuits. And we have clinical trials demonstrating meaningful symptom reduction in anxious populations.

But we are still in the early chapters of this research. Sample sizes need to grow. Protocols need to be standardised. Long-term data need to be collected. And the role of taVNS within broader treatment frameworks needs to be clearly defined.

What the research does suggest — carefully and with appropriate caveats — is that the vagus nerve represents a genuine target for anxiety intervention. Not a cure. Not a replacement for established treatments. But a biologically plausible, evidence-supported tool that may help restore the autonomic balance that anxiety disrupts.
