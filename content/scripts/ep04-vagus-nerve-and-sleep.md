Sleep is one of the most fundamental biological processes — and one of the most disrupted. Chronic insomnia affects an estimated ten to fifteen per cent of adults globally, and poor sleep quality is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, cognitive decline, and mental health disorders.

Over the past decade, a growing body of research has begun to explore a question that connects two major areas of neuroscience: what is the relationship between the vagus nerve and sleep? And can vagus nerve stimulation improve sleep quality?

In this episode, we'll examine the evidence — from the basic physiology of vagal tone and sleep architecture to the clinical trials investigating VNS as an intervention for sleep disorders.

## SECTION 1: VAGAL TONE AND THE AUTONOMIC REGULATION OF SLEEP

[VISUAL CUE: Animated twenty-four-hour clock showing the autonomic nervous system shifting balance — sympathetic dominance during waking hours, parasympathetic dominance increasing as night approaches. A heart rate variability trace runs along the bottom.]

To understand the connection between the vagus nerve and sleep, we need to start with the autonomic nervous system.

Sleep is not a passive state. It's an actively regulated process that requires a significant shift in autonomic balance. During waking hours, the sympathetic nervous system is relatively dominant — supporting alertness, physical activity, and engagement with the environment. As we transition toward sleep, parasympathetic activity increases progressively, and sympathetic tone decreases.

The vagus nerve is the principal conduit of parasympathetic outflow. Its activity — commonly referred to as vagal tone — directly influences heart rate, respiratory patterns, and the broader physiological state that enables sleep onset and maintenance.

[VISUAL CUE: Graph showing heart rate variability across a twenty-four-hour period — HRV rising during sleep, peaking during deep sleep, and dropping during waking hours.]

Vagal tone is most commonly measured through heart rate variability, or HRV — the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate that reflects the dynamic interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs to the sinoatrial node. Higher HRV generally indicates greater parasympathetic influence and more adaptive autonomic regulation.

Research has consistently demonstrated that HRV increases during sleep — particularly during non-REM sleep stages — and that individuals with higher resting vagal tone tend to report better sleep quality. Conversely, individuals with insomnia and other sleep disorders frequently exhibit reduced HRV, suggesting diminished parasympathetic function.

[VISUAL CUE: Scatter plot graphic illustrating the correlation between resting HRV and self-reported sleep quality scores, with a positive trend line.]

A study by Bonnet and Arand, published in the journal *Sleep*, found that patients with chronic insomnia showed elevated heart rate and reduced HRV across the entire twenty-four-hour cycle — not just at night — suggesting a persistent state of autonomic hyperarousal. This finding has been replicated across multiple studies and is now considered a core feature of insomnia pathophysiology.

The implication is significant: if insomnia is partly characterised by insufficient parasympathetic activation, then enhancing vagal tone could, in principle, address an underlying mechanism of the disorder rather than merely inducing sedation.

## SECTION 2: SLEEP ARCHITECTURE AND THE VAGUS NERVE

[VISUAL CUE: Hypnogram — a visual representation of sleep stages across a typical night. Stages labelled: Wake, N1, N2, N3 (slow-wave sleep), and REM. Parasympathetic activity level is overlaid as a colour gradient.]

Sleep is composed of distinct stages that cycle approximately every ninety minutes. These include light sleep — stages N1 and N2 — deep slow-wave sleep — stage N3 — and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. Each stage has a characteristic pattern of brain activity, muscle tone, and autonomic regulation.

Slow-wave sleep is of particular interest in the context of vagal tone. During this stage, parasympathetic activity reaches its peak. Heart rate slows, blood pressure drops, and the body enters its most restorative physiological state. Slow-wave sleep is critical for immune function, tissue repair, memory consolidation, and metabolic regulation.

[VISUAL CUE: EEG trace showing the characteristic high-amplitude, low-frequency delta waves of slow-wave sleep. An overlay shows vagal tone peaking during these periods.]

Research suggests that the vagus nerve plays a role in modulating sleep architecture itself — not just the autonomic conditions that support sleep. Animal studies have shown that vagal afferent signalling influences the activity of brain regions directly involved in sleep-wake regulation, including the nucleus tractus solitarius, the locus coeruleus, the raphe nuclei, and the thalamus.

The NTS, which receives the majority of vagal afferent input, has direct projections to the parabrachial nucleus and the reticular formation — structures involved in arousal and sleep-state transitions. Serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei, which are modulated by vagal input, play a well-established role in the regulation of sleep onset and sleep architecture.

[VISUAL CUE: Brain diagram showing the pathway — vagal afferents to NTS, then projections to locus coeruleus (noradrenaline), raphe nuclei (serotonin), and thalamus. Each neurotransmitter's role in sleep is briefly labelled.]

This anatomical and neurochemical framework provides a mechanistic rationale for how vagus nerve stimulation might influence sleep — by modulating the brainstem circuits that govern sleep-wake transitions and sleep stage architecture.

## SECTION 3: VNS AND NEUROTRANSMITTER PATHWAYS RELEVANT TO SLEEP

[VISUAL CUE: Three parallel pathways shown as flowing diagrams — the serotonin pathway, the GABA pathway, and the noradrenaline pathway — each traced from vagal input through brainstem nuclei to their effects on sleep regulation.]

Several neurotransmitter systems that are modulated by vagus nerve stimulation are directly relevant to sleep regulation.

Serotonin, produced by the dorsal raphe nuclei, is a precursor to melatonin — the hormone that regulates circadian rhythm and sleep onset. Vagal afferent activation has been shown to increase serotonin release in the raphe nuclei. Evidence from both animal and human studies indicates that VNS enhances serotonergic transmission, which could, in turn, support melatonin production and circadian regulation.

[VISUAL CUE: Biochemical pathway — tryptophan converted to serotonin (5-HT) in the raphe nuclei, then serotonin converted to melatonin in the pineal gland. VNS influence indicated at the serotonin synthesis step.]

Gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter and is central to sleep initiation. The ventrolateral preoptic area — the brain's "sleep switch" — uses GABAergic signalling to inhibit arousal centres during sleep onset. Research suggests that VNS may enhance GABAergic tone, potentially facilitating the neural inhibition required for sleep onset.

Noradrenaline, released by the locus coeruleus, has a more complex relationship with sleep. The locus coeruleus is most active during waking, less active during non-REM sleep, and nearly silent during REM sleep. VNS modulates locus coeruleus activity, and the nature of this modulation — whether it enhances or attenuates noradrenergic signalling — may depend on stimulation parameters and timing.

[VISUAL CUE: Graph showing locus coeruleus firing rate across sleep stages — high during wake, low during non-REM, near zero during REM.]

These neurochemical pathways are not speculative. They are well-established components of sleep neuroscience, and VNS has demonstrable effects on each of them. The question is whether these effects translate into clinically meaningful improvements in sleep.

## SECTION 4: CLINICAL EVIDENCE — VNS FOR SLEEP

[VISUAL CUE: Transition to clinical trial data. Study design graphics — randomised controlled trial schematic with treatment and sham groups.]

The most directly relevant clinical evidence comes from a randomised controlled trial by Jiao and colleagues, published in 2020, which investigated transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation for chronic insomnia.

In this trial, patients with primary insomnia were randomised to receive either active taVNS or sham stimulation over a four-week treatment period. The primary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index — a validated, widely used measure of sleep quality.

[VISUAL CUE: Citation card — "Jiao et al., 2020 — taVNS for chronic insomnia, randomised controlled trial."]

The results were encouraging. The active taVNS group showed significant improvements in sleep quality compared to the sham group. Improvements were observed in sleep onset latency — the time it takes to fall asleep — sleep duration, and overall sleep quality scores. The effects were maintained at follow-up assessment.

[VISUAL CUE: Bar chart comparing Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores before and after treatment in the taVNS group versus the sham group. Both groups improve, but the taVNS group improves significantly more.]

Beyond this trial, evidence from implanted VNS in epilepsy populations has provided additional insights. Several studies have observed changes in sleep architecture among epilepsy patients receiving iVNS, including alterations in the proportion of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. However, these findings are mixed — some studies report improvements in sleep quality while others report increased daytime sleepiness or sleep disruption, potentially related to stimulation timing and parameters.

[VISUAL CUE: Summary table — studies examining VNS effects on sleep, listing authors, year, VNS type, population, and key sleep-related findings.]

A systematic review by Cheng and colleagues examined the effects of taVNS on sleep quality across multiple studies and found a generally positive trend, though the authors noted significant heterogeneity in study designs, stimulation protocols, and outcome measures. They concluded that while preliminary evidence is promising, larger and more standardised trials are needed.

It is also worth noting observational research linking VNS to improvements in sleep in patients with depression. Given the strong bidirectional relationship between sleep and mood, it can be difficult to disentangle whether VNS improves sleep directly or whether sleep improvements are secondary to improvements in depressive symptoms.

## SECTION 5: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS

[VISUAL CUE: Clean infographic layout with three columns — "What We Know," "What We Don't Know," and "What's Next."]

Let's be clear about where the evidence stands.

What we know: vagal tone, as measured by HRV, is closely linked to sleep quality. Parasympathetic dominance is a prerequisite for healthy sleep. VNS modulates brainstem nuclei and neurotransmitter systems directly involved in sleep regulation. And at least one well-designed randomised controlled trial has demonstrated that taVNS can improve sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia.

What we don't know: the optimal stimulation parameters for sleep-specific effects — frequency, intensity, duration, and critically, timing of stimulation relative to sleep. We don't know whether daytime stimulation, evening stimulation, or stimulation during sleep itself would produce the best outcomes. We don't have long-term efficacy data. And we don't yet understand the dose-response relationship — how much stimulation is needed, and whether more is necessarily better.

[VISUAL CUE: Clock graphic showing question marks at different times — morning, afternoon, evening, during sleep — highlighting the unknown of optimal timing.]

There are also methodological challenges. Sleep research relies on both subjective measures — like questionnaires — and objective measures — like polysomnography and actigraphy. Many existing VNS-sleep studies have relied primarily on subjective measures, and the field would benefit from more studies incorporating objective polysomnographic data.

Additionally, most studies to date have been relatively small and short in duration. While the mechanistic rationale is strong and the preliminary clinical evidence is encouraging, the level of evidence does not yet approach what exists for VNS in epilepsy or depression. Larger, multi-centre randomised controlled trials with standardised protocols are the logical next step.

## OUTRO

[VISUAL CUE: The hypnogram from Section 2 returns, with vagal tone overlay. Slow zoom out to show the full night's sleep architecture. Fade to Vagus Research logo.]

To summarise: the vagus nerve is intimately connected to the physiological processes that regulate sleep. Vagal tone — reflected in heart rate variability — is a key marker of the parasympathetic activation that enables healthy sleep onset and maintenance. VNS modulates brainstem nuclei, serotonergic and GABAergic pathways, and autonomic balance — all of which are directly involved in sleep regulation.

Clinical evidence, including a randomised controlled trial by Jiao and colleagues, suggests that transcutaneous auricular VNS can improve sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia. The mechanistic rationale is sound. But the field is still in its early stages, and larger, more standardised trials are needed to establish optimal protocols and long-term efficacy.

What is clear is that the relationship between vagal function and sleep represents one of the more promising frontiers in VNS research — and one we'll continue to follow as new evidence emerges.
